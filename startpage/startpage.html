		<p class="alert">The Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) is a questionnaire developed by Dr. Jonathan Davidson at Duke University for screening and measuring generalized social anxiety disorder. The assessment scale consists of 17 items covering the spectrum of social phobia such as fear, avoidance, and physiological factors. Each item is ranked by the test taker on a scale of intensity, from “Not at All” to “Extremely” and assigned a corresponding number value. A score higher than 19 indicates likelihood of a social anxiety disorder.</p>
